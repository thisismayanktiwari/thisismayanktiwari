**Hey there, I'm Mayank 🙋‍♂️**

### About me

**Currently I am:** A graduate student at New York University (NYU) studying Management of Technology with a concentration in Data Analytics. 

**How I started:**
My data science journey began in early 2020 when I took my first business analytics class at NYU and was astonished by the stunning possiblities that a seemingly mundane dataset holds. Since that day, I have not looked back and have been constantly working at expanding my knowledge and skillset in this extraordinary field.
